        I’m Ivan, and I live in Porto, Portugal. Thanks for visiting my site.<br>
        <br> I’ve been always trying to figure out how things work, how they’re created
        and how can they be improved since my early age, and that curiosity led
        me into programming.<br>
        <br> I have worked as an Android developer, building management software for
        Android mobile devices and I’ve done some freelance work, connecting the
        dots for iOS apps.<br>
        <br> You can find more about my iOS apps <a href="https://ivancantarino.com/appsshowcase/appsshowcase.html">here.</a><br>
        <br> Follow what I'm up on <a href="https://twitter.com/ivancantarino">Twitter</a>.<br>
